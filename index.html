                        Lionel Andrés Messi Cuccittini (Spanish pronunciation: [ljoˈnel anˈdɾez ˈmesi] born 24 June
                        1987) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward for Spanish club Barcelona
                        and the Argentina national team. Often considered the best player in the world and regarded by
                        many as the greatest of all time, Messi has a record-tying five Ballon d'Or awards,
                        four of which he won consecutively, and a record-tying four European Golden Shoes. He has spent
                        his entire professional career with Barcelona, where he has won 30 trophies, including eight La
                        Liga titles, four UEFA Champions League titles, and five Copas del Rey. Both a prolific
                        goalscorer and a creative playmaker, Messi holds the records for most official goals scored in
                        La Liga (378), a La Liga season (50), a club football season in Europe (73), a calendar year
                        (91), El Clásico (25), as well as those for most assists in La Liga (149) and the Copa América
                        (11). He has scored over 600 senior career goals for club and country.
                        Born and raised in central Argentina, Messi was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency as a
                        child. At age 13, he relocated to Spain to join Barcelona, who agreed to pay for his medical
                        treatment. After a fast progression through Barcelona's youth academy, Messi made his
                        competitive debut aged 17 in October 2004. Despite being injury-prone during his early career,
                        he established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years, finishing
                        2007 as a finalist for both the Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year award, a feat he
                        repeated the following year. His first uninterrupted campaign came in the 2008–09 season, during
                        which he helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football. At 22 years old, Messi
                        won the Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year award by record voting margins.
